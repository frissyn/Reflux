[January 14, 2021- Snow]


It has truly been a joy working to maintain Reflux, and Reflux will forever remain one of my favorite projects I've worked on. Collaborating with frissyn has also been one of my favorite collaborations (~~not that I've done a lot of them~~). However, with great sadness it's time to let Reflux go. **Reflux is deprecated as of now, and will no longer receive new features. Reflux will receive critical updates until EOL, which is scheduled for December 31, 2022**. This decision came after learning about a few exciting things Replit has in the works. No words yet, and it'll take a while, but Reflux will soon no longer be needed. Reflux was already falling behind a few months ago until I offered to help support it. Frissyn brought up one of the larget widespread Replit theming platforms Replit has seen. Reflux has gone through a whole transformation thanks to frissyn (#6) and seen syntax highlighting. Its seen support for the editor as well as the console/shell. Despite the negativity it earned throughout its time, Reflux stayed consistent with its main goal- to bring extensive theming abilities to everyone.

(Side note, I was a collaborator on this project. Frissyn always has the last say and could revert this decision at any time ðŸ¤ª)
